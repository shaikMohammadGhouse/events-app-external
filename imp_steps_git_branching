Try creating a branch called: new-feature-X
Make a change and commit in that branch
Switch back to the master branch
Look at code
Switch back to new-feature-X
Look at code
Merge the changes back to master
For more detailed steps, use the next two slides for help
----------------------------------------------------------
To list all branches:
git branch
To create a branch:
git branch new-feature-X 
To select a branch:
git checkout new-feature-X
Make changes to code and commit changes the normal way:
git commit -a -m "some message"
Can switch between branches with:
git checkout master
git checkout new-feature-X
---------------------------------------------
To merge a branch to master:
First checkout the master:
git checkout master
Then merge the branch:
git merge new-feature-X
May need to resolve conflicts
--------------------------------------
Nominate one team member to host the main repo in GitHub
That person needs to invite the other teammates 
In the GitHub external repo: click Settings, click Manage Access, click Invite a collaborator, enter email of teammates
Other teammates need to check email and accept invite
Teammates now need to clone repo
In Cloud Shell, issue the following commands:
mkdir ~/shared-repos
cd ~/shared-repos
git clone <GIT_HUB_URL_TO_SHARED_EXTERNAL_REPO> 
ls
-------------------------
Each teammate should now try to:
Create a branch in the new repo
Make a change to the branch
Merge the branch with the master branch
